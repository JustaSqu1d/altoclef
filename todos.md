# TODO's Short Term Features/Improvements

- Target one neutral mob at a time, and kill it. Then move on to the next one.
- Re-write the tracking system to be more efficient and less buggy.
- Re-write the config system to support the native config system.

# TODO's: Long Term Future Features

- Automate resetting runs/starting new runs (AKA self-speedrunning)
- Smart tasks that are user customizable. Give resources json-assignable descriptions on how they CAN be obtained, and
  the system automatically tries to obtain it in the fastest way.
- Given any schematic, Collect ALL resources and BUILD the schematic, ideally from a fresh survival world if possible.
- Initialize and control multiple bots over a network. Kind of like an RTS game.
- Make this bot able to survive anarchy
- All acheivements, fully autonomous (not happening any time soon lol)
